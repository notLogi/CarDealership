## Dealership Manager
The dealership manager allows the user to manage their inventory. It also allows custom search between the characteristics.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to search up vehicles depending on their characteristics.
- As a user, I want to have access to multiple dealerships, so I can see what my cars are available.
- As a user, I want to see what the department has in its inventory, so I can see what cars interest me.
## Some features include:

**Read data from CSV files**
- Users can provide a CSV file in a format that lists the vehicles available.

**Viewing the dealership's inventory**
- Users can view their inventory based on their filter chosen in the menu

**Add and remove vehicles**
- Users can remove and add their vehicles from the CSV file.

## Interesting Part of my Code:
- An interesting part of my code is the DealerShipManager class, where it does not directly create a Dealership class, instead gets data and returns it when needed.
